    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>My name is Giulia and I created this website to tell something (I hope) interesting about myself which could support my application to <strong><a href="https://foundersandcoders.com/">Founders&Coders<a/></strong>.</p>
  <p>I am an Italian living in London, a philosphy graduate and charity worker with a passion for music, politics and foreign languages.</p>
  <p>I've always been an extremely curious person, eager to learn new things and challenge myself.</p> 
   <p>After thinking for years that coding was 'too difficult' for me, last summer I decided to give it a try and I discovered that I love it!</p>
    <p>In the future I dream to become a skilled software developer to build websites and apps that have a positive impact on society.</p>
   <p>For now, I am having fun learning and experimenting with Javascript on <strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/giuliateggi">freeCodeCamp</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/Giulia">Codewars</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/GiuliaTeggi/languages-project">Github</a></strong>.</p>

      <p>In my life I've had the chance to learn six different languages, each of which opened up new worlds to me and offered me new ways of thinking. This website is dedicated to these languages and how they enriched and changed my life.</p>

      <h2>Italian</h2>
      <p>Italian is the language I grew up with, and which I am proud of speaking. It is a cheerful, melodic and colourful language, full of funny expressions and ways of saying derived from the many Italian dialects and always accompanied by dozens of hand gestures.</p> 
       <p>It is a language that always instantly makes me feel more outgoing and emotional, ready to enjoy la dolce vita.</p> 
      <p>Italian changed my life because it gave me the opportunity to discover and read the original works of some of the best writers and poets of all times, from Dante to Leopardi to Pavese, who shaped my way of seeing the world.</p>

    <h2>French</h2>
         <p>I was born in a bilingual region in the Alps, on the border between Italy and France, where I studied French language and literature at school for more than 15 years.</p> 
   <p>Studying the language and culture of the people living 'on the other side of the mountains' from where I lived made me reflect on the similarities and differences between cultures from a young age and develop a strong critical sense, which then led me to fell in love with the books of Sartre and Camus and to study philosophy at university.<p>
       <p>Some of my best school memories are linked to French, such as when I saw my favourite play, The Bald Soprano of Eugène Ionesco, in the tiny Théâtre de la Huchette in Paris, or the two weeks I spent on a school exchange in southern France, discovering new teaching methods and meeting French learners from all over Europe.</p>

    <h2>Latin and Ancient Greek</h2>
     <p>The 'Liceo Classico', the type of secondary school I attended in Italy, is one of the few public schools in Europe that teaches both Latin and Ancient Greek, two 'dead languages' which, at first sight, might seems useless.</p>
   <p>However, precisely because Latin and Ancient Greek are languages that are hard to learn, with complex grammar rules and grammatical cases and no living native speakers, they taught me to be perseverant, to analyse and break down complex texts and, more in general, to think logically.<p> 
    <p>Moreover, Classical Greek and Latin cultures are the foundation of European culture. Studying these languages made me reflect on our common heritage and shared values and understand the root of the majority of European words.</p>

    <h2>Spanish</h2>
  <p>Spanish is the language I've learnt more recently, mainly to communicate with the family of my partner, who is Venezuelan.</p>
  <p>Venezuelan Spanish is a bit like the 'chilled out' version of Spanish, with lots of slang phrases and a propension to shorten all the words. </p>
   <p>Thanks to this language I could immerse myself in the Venezuelan culture and learn more about South America, its history and its delicious food.<p>
   <p>I also discovered music that otherwise I would have never found out about, from Argentine and Brazilian rock to Mexican rap to Celia Cruz, the queen of salsa.</p>

    <h2>English</h2>
     <p>English is the foreign language that has had the greatest impact on my life, allowing me to realise many of my dreams and to find my first full-time job.</p> 
     <p>My first contact with this language happened through music and my passion for British rock. I started learning English by printing the lyrics of my favourite songs and searching on the dictionary the meaning of every single word.</p> 
    <p>Eventually, thanks to my knowledge of English I could study abroad for a year, make friends with people from all over the world, and broaden my horizons. After six months of unemployment, English offered me a future: a job in the UK, in the sector I've always loved. All these experiences brought me to where I am today, moving my very first steps in the world of coding, excited about the opportunities that awaits me in the future.</p>
